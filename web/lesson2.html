        <p> Websites consist of two main parts: the front-end and the back-end. The front end involves the things that are processed in the client side (in the user&#39;s browser instead of in a server). For example, all the structure, design, and basic functionality of a website is part of the front-end. When a server is involved, however, this is the back-end. This involves a browser asking a server to log in, or getting information from the internet, etc. We will begin by learning the front end. This include a few languages:.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>HTML: HyperText Markup Language: This is the basic structure of a website that a user can see. It includes all the actual elements of the website, like paragraphs, content, etc, but with no formatting or style. Websites with only HTML are completely static, and of course don&#39;t communicate with the internet (no backe-end). </p></li>
        
            <li><p>CSS: Used along with html to make a website pretty. CSS styles involve backgrounds, spacing, color, positioning, transitions, etc. All these things can be added to your html to make your website aesthetically pleasing. CSS is very easy to learn, and is always used in web dev.</p></li>
        
            <li><p>JavaScript: This is a full programming language (unlike HTML and CSS). It includes all the loops/functions/objects of a language like Java, although it is used mainly for web development. We use JavaScript to give some user interaction. For example, when the user clicks a button, we use js to change the CSS color of the button to blue. Or when the user hits submit, we use js to change the content in an HTML element to something else. JavaScript will also be used in the backend with something called Node.js.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these three main languages we will build a full front-end website. Let&#39;s begin.</p>
