           <p>We know that learning all of these programming languages at once can be overwhelming. So we have here some supplementary resources that can help you while learning all of these things. </p>

           <p>The first one is a YouTube channel by the name of TheNewBoston. The owner, who's name is Bucky, has huge amounts of experience with programming, and knows a lot about web development. There are tutorials for basically every programming language you can think of. If you need further practice with some of these languages, you can watch some of the videos. You can skip through the slow ones if you already know the content. The HTML5 tutorials are specifically helpful for getting more practice with HTML5 and CSS3. Here is the link: </p>

           <br/><br/>

           <p>Another great tutorial series on YouTube is one created by Derek Banas. These tutorials focus on JavaScript, JQuery, and AJAX, so they can be very helpful. In fact they are very fast, so they are a great complement to the content on this website. If you watch these few JS tutorials, you should be set for industry quality JS scripting.</p>

           <br/><br/>

           <p>Finally for some complementary material for backend coding: If you would like to code JavaScript in the server, Node.js is the language for you. The guide in weboux will cover the basics, but if you want to go deeper and learn more, you should look at this online book. It covers most of the things you need to know, and it would be good to keep in handy, if only just for reference. Either way, it is very well written and proved to be very helpful for me. Here is the link: </p>

           <a href="http://www.nodebeginner.org/"> Node Guide</a>
           <br/><br/>

           <p>If, however, you prefer to use a more traditional language such as PHP, you can also find many great tutorials for in TheNewBoston's site. Weboux will be using Node.js, but some people prefer PHP, and that should be fine for many things.</p>
